\begin{abstract}
 In this paper we evaluate the SHADE-LM algorithm on the BBOB noiseless testbed.
 The algorithm hybridizes the SHADE algorithm with a model based optimization.
 This hybridization is performed in a transparent manner for both optimizers,
 with SHADE having access to the samples improved by model based optimization,
 and models of square function are fitted on the current population.
 The paper compares this extended version with the performance of original
 R-SHADE and KL-BIPOP-CMAES.

\section{Introduction}

R-SHADE \cite{Tanabe2014} algorithm has been proposed as one of the more successful
modification of Differential Evolution, following the path of adapting the scale
and cross-over probability factors, employing the archive of previous best samples,
utilizing the current-to-best position update and restart mechanism based on population
locations or values spread.

Hybridizing plain Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE)
algorithms with model based optimizer has already been proved
to improve their performance \cite{zaborski2019generalized,zaborski2020analysis,Okulewicz2020}.

In this paper we utilize our Generalized Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (GAPSO) framework
\cite{ulinski2018generalized,Okulewicz2020}
and implement within it a version of SHADE \cite{Tanabe2014} and model based optimizer \cite{zaborski2020analysis}.
%
\section{GAPSO Framework Concept}
The concept of GAPSO framework is to allow for hybridization of optimization algorithms,
in a way which will be transparent to the hybridized methods.
This approach comes from the observation that methods such as PSO or DE,
need only a minimal amount of information (i.e. locations and values
of the previously sampled locations). Please note that PSO's velocity
is simply a difference between previous and current location.
Therefore an algorithm which stores current, previous and best location
for each individual (particle) allows to employ sampling of both DE and PSO
based algorithms, in a transparent manner from the point of view of individual.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the {SHADE-LM}
on the {bbob test suite \cite{hansen2010fun}} with restarts for a maximum budget
equal to {$10^6D)$} function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}.
The {Java} code was run on  single core of a {Windows Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz}.
The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} and \cite{hansen2016perfass} on the
benchmark functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2010fun} are
presented in Figures~\ref{fig:scaling}, \ref{fig:ECDFs05D} and
\ref{fig:ECDFs20D} and in Tables~\ref{tab:ERTs5} and~\ref{tab:ERTs20}.
The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2020cocoplat}, version
{2.3}, the plots were produced with version {2.4}.

The \textbf{expected runtime (ERT)}, used in the figures and tables,
depends on a given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is
computed over all relevant trials as the number of function
evaluations executed during each trial while the best function value
did not reach \ftarget, summed over all trials and divided by the
number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2012exp,price1997dev}.  \textbf{Statistical significance}
is tested with the rank-sum test for a given target $\Delta\ftarget$
%($10^{-8}$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling})
using, for each trial,
either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target
was not reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved, measured only up to
the smallest number of overall function evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration.
